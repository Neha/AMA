# :four_leaf_clover: AMA - Ask Me Anything !! :book:
 Hello!! My name is Neha Sharma. You probably came to this repo by [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nehha/), Youtube, or [twitter](https://twitter.com/hellonehha). You might know me from [JSLovers](www.jslovers.com) _organizer_, _Tech speaker_, and _UI Developer_. 
 
People keep reaching me at different platforms about their doubts, questions, suggestions, asking for mentoring. No matter how hard I try ,I always miss replaying to everone. 

Hence, this repo is the one dedicated place where you can ask me anything* and I will reply you. 
 
 ## :loudspeaker: Why I am doing this?

 ## :raising_hand: What you can ask me?
 To be honest , it should be only and only related to Technology , Meetups, and Career.
 
 _Questions I won't be replying to: My personal life._
